# Odin Sign-Up Form Project

## üìå Overview

This is a sign-up form project from **The Odin Project** curriculum. It demonstrates HTML form structure, CSS styling for inputs and layout, and basic JavaScript for password validation.

This page is part of a continuous journey and collection of authentication pages, each built using different technologies. Upcoming pages will feature React, Vue.js, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Firebase.

The design includes:
- A left sidebar with a background image and logo.
- A right section with the sign-up form and introductory text.
- Password validation that checks if both fields match.
